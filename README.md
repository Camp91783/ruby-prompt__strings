# Prompt - Ruby

## Strings

### Objectives

1. Learn about strings in Ruby.

### Instructions

Research and then write answers to the following questions in **lib/strings.md**.

- What is a String?
-   a group of characters that make up easily readable words or sentences.
-   enclosed in quotes
-   
- What are some examples of information that would be Strings as opposed to some other data type?
-   names, colors, basically similar information
-   
- What is one way, using Ruby, to retrieve the 6th character in a String like `"Ada Lovelace"`? How about the 8th character? What happens if you try to retrieve the value of the _99th_ character (Or any character that doesn't exist)?
-   name = "Ada Lovelace"
-   puts name[5]=> o
-   puts name [7]=> e
-   
- The previous question asks about finding, for example, the 6th character in a String. Is it possible to find the **-6th** (Notice the negative symbol!) character in a String? What does that even mean?
-   start at the end and go backward
-   ex.) **-6**
-   
- What is one way, using Ruby, to replace certain characters in a string with some other set of characters? For example, given `"Sumeet Jain"`, how would you replace all of the `e` characters in my name with exclamation marks? (So it would be `"Sum!!t Jain"`.)
-   use the sub method for the 1st instance
-   use the gsub method for all other instances
-   

Remember two things:

1. You don't need to submit any code to us for this assignment. Just provide in-your-own-words answers for the questions above.
2. We're not looking for any kind of advanced writing skills nor any kind of length. Just be clear and thoughtful about what you write--organize it however it makes sense for you.

### Resources

As always, one resource is Google. Some of the questions above can by entered verbatim into a Google search, and for others that won't be as effective. Either way, expect to read (or watch videos) about more than just the simple answer to each question. Often a question's answer--even one that seems short or simple--doesn't really make sense until after you've read the paragraphs before and after it.
